# DCAMS Styles

This project contains the styles used by the Digital Claimant Activity Messaging Service.

The [DCAMS prototype](https://ejs-dcams.herokuapp.com/) can be viewed as an example of these styles.

This is designed to work with the styles in the [GOVUK prototype kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit).

To get this into the prototype do the following steps
1. Copy the _admin.scss file and the sass folder including contents to the app/assets/sass folder.
2. Add the `@import 'admin';` to the application.scss in the same folder.
